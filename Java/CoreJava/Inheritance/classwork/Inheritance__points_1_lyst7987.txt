Inheritance :

Inheritance refers to one class acquiring properties and behaviour of another class.

It also refers to writing the program as heirarchy of classes rather than one class.

We use extends keyword to achieve inheritance.

It;s also refered as Is-A relationship. It will make sense to use Inheritance concept if there is is - A relationship exisits,


====================================================================================================

Parents class== Super class == Base class

Child class==Derived class == Sub class

Object class is parent of all classes in Java. 

===========================================================================

Keypoints to be noted:

Single level inheritance is allowed.

Multilevel  Inheritance is allowed.( One class has its parent that has its Parent so on....)

Cyclic Inheritance is not allowed.

Multiple Inheritance is not allowed. It will lead to ambiguity to compiler. Also refered as Diamond shaped problem.
(refer board work notes and class recordings). i.e one class cannot extends multiple classes at a time.

One parent class can have multiple child classes.

private members of a class cannot participate in Inheritance.This is to preserve encapsulation. 

Constructor will not participate in Inheritance, however it will be executed bcz of super() call in child class Constructor.
