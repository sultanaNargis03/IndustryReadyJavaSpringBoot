Inherited methods: Such methods which are inherited from Parent to Child and used as its in Child class without any chnage in behaviour.

Overridden methods:  Such methods which are inherited from Parent to Child and Modified in child class to suite child class requirement.

Specialized method: Such methods which are there only in Child class not in the parent class.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rules to be followed to override a method in Child/sub class:

 we cannot reduce visibility of the overridden methods.

 we can increase the visibility of the overridden methods.

 we cannot change the return type for overridden methods.

 we can change the return type for overridden methods However to make this,  the return type must be  Co-Varient return type.
(Is-A relationship must exists between return types).

 We cannot change parameter list of overriden methods in child class. If we do so it will be conisdered as specilized method of Child class by following Concepts of Method overloading.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Polymorphism or Runtime Polymorphism can be achieved a) By Creating Parent type refrence for Child type Object
                             B) By method overridding (To show diff behaviour at the run time)

Abstraction --> abstarct keyword ----> Hiding implementation ===> Providing requirement to be implemented


Abstarction --> a) abstract class b)interface

---> Abstract class is such a class which will have an Abstract method.

---> Abstract methods are such methods which will have only method signature no body/implementation.

---> Abstract class can have all methods abstract.

--> Abstract class can have both abstract and concrete methods.

==> Abstract class reference variable can be created so that we can achieve polymorphism.

--> Abstract class cannot be Instantiated. (Object cannot be created)

--> It's responsibility of Child class to give implementation for an ABstract class. However if a class extends an Abstract class and does't give implementation for abstract methods on that class then that child class must also declared abstract.

--> A class can be abstract, method can be abstract but we cannot make a variable abstract.
